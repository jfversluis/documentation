Logging in Shiny is built into the very core of the framework.  We use Microsoft.Extensions.Logging as our abstraction point to allow for all sorts of logging
configuration and providers.  

With Shiny and especially background services, it is important to know that providers like debug and console won't work.  The reason is simple, when the background
delegates/jobs execute, the debugger is not attached.  Thus, we recommend using loggers that write to a file or a database.

Some suggested logging provider nugets:

|Provider|NuGet|
|--------|-----|
|NReco.Logging.File|<NugetBadge name="NReco.Logging.File" />|
|Shiny.Logging.AppCenter|<NugetBadge name="Shiny.Logging.AppCenter" />|
