## What are they?
Startup services are a great way to hook events IMMEDIATELY after the dependency injection container has been built.  They support full dependency injection like other services.

The startup of these services is NOT asynchronous for a reason - the startup of your application is not asynchronous.  If you go async, the platform is not waiting for you to finish.



## Setup

```csharp
namespace Whatever;

public class MyStartupService : Shiny.IShinyStartupTask
{
    public void Start()
    {
        // great to hook global events here (ie. Logout, delete local database?)
    }
}
```
