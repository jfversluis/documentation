Shiny for the client side has its own hosting model to allow it to work across the whole .NET client side ecosystem.  Shiny is more of a framework with plugins built around
it, than it is a "one off" plugin for a XF or MAUI application.  It is recommended not recommended you take a dependency on Shiny for a single plugin.

The best way to get started with Shiny application is to use out templates <NugetBadge name="Shiny.Templates" client:load />

> dotnet new install Shiny.Templates

However, if you have an existing application, please try our [App Builder](./appbuilder) to help generate all of the pieces you need.
