import LibBuilder from '../../../components/Boilerplate/LibBuilder';

## Getting Started 

As developers, we often take internet connectivity and speed for granted.  Mobile phones are taking HUGE sized photos these days that can take quite some time to upload.

## Features

* Background Uploads & Downloads on each platform
* Supports transfer filtering based on metered connections (iOS & UWP only at the moment)
* Event Based Metrics
  * Percentage Complete
  * Total Bytes Expected
  * Total Bytes Transferred
  * Transfer Speed (Bytes Per Second)
  * Estimated Completion Time

## Setup

<LibBuilder componentName="httptransfers" client:load />


## Background Delegate

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Shiny;
using Shiny.Net.Http;

namespace YourNamespace;


public class MyHttpTransferDelegate : IHttpTransferDelegate
{

    public Task OnError(HttpTransfer transfer, Exception ex) 
    {
    }

    public async Task OnCompleted(HttpTransfer transfer)
    {
    }
}

```
