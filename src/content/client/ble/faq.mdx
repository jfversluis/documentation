<Expander header="Can I use IPeripheral.UUID to refer to my device across app restarts">
NO - if your device is not paired. Treat UUIDs as a "per scan" basis.  The UUID is not guaranteed to be the same across app restarts
YES - if your device is paired.  It is usually better to use manufacturer data or advertised service UUIDs to identify your peripheral(s).

<Expander header="Why is there no way to active monitor status of the Bluetooth adapter (IBleManager.WhenStatusChanged)?">
In a lot of cases, state changes to the Bluetooth adapter happen when your app is fully backgrounded, not the settings flip that developers
like to test with.  Observable subscriptions do NOT survive app sleeps/restarts.  For this scenario, you must use the IBleDelegate.OnAdapterStatusChanged

<Expander header="Why does RequestAccess cover the Bluetooth adapter state and the permissions?">
You would be making these same 2 calls under every start scenario.  We wanted a one-stop shop.  The AccessState is a great combination that covers
all states we tend to come across when dealing with device permissions and availability.  This allowed us to keep a consistent API in RequestAccess across
all Shiny libraries
