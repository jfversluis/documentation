Background jobs are necessary in almost all forms of applications now a days.  Client apps are no different, especiall on mobile.  Under the hood,
Shiny uses [Android WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) and [iOS BGTaskScheduler](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks/bgprocessingtaskrequest) to performance background jobs.

<Aside type="caution">
It should be noted, jobs are NOT scheduled.  They are executed periodically by the operating system based on a number of factors (battery, network, when your user usually uses your app).  If you need something with more
fine grained execution in terms of timing, it is recommended you look into push notifications.
