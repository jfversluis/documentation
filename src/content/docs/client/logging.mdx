Logging in Shiny is built into the very core of the framework.  We use Microsoft.Extensions.Logging as our abstraction point to allow for all sorts of logging
configuration and providers.  

With Shiny and especially background services, it is important to know that providers like debug and console won't work.  The reason is simple, when the background
delegates/jobs execute, the debugger is not attached.  Thus, we recommend using loggers that write to a file or a database.

Some suggested logging provider nugets:

|Provider|NuGet|
|--------|-----|
|Shiny.Logging.Sqlite|<NugetBadge name="Shiny.Logging.Sqlite" />|
|Shiny.Logging.AppCenter|<NugetBadge name="Shiny.Logging.AppCenter" />|

## Logging Within Your App

Within any component that has been registered with your dependency injection container, you can now do the following

```csharp
using Microsoft.Logging.Extensions;

namespace MyNamespace;

public class MyThing {

    public MyThing(ILogger<MyThing> logger)
    {
        logger.LogInformation("Hello World");
    }
}
```


## App AppCenter

The AppCenter library can be used without any other Shiny module or wiring.  It only requires the standing Microsoft.Logging.Extensions wiring

<MauiRegistration componentName="appcenter" />

:::tip
Notice how there is no reference to AppCenter within your actual code other than the registration

## SQLite

SQLite logging is great for local testing of your background delegates as it doesn't require much additional setup
and a log viewer can be created right inside your app

<MauiRegistration componentName="sqlite" />
