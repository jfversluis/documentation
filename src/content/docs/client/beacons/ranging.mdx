```csharp
IBeaconRangingManager rangingManager;

## Managed Scan

The managed scan is meant to make it easier to show scan results for beacons.  It will manage things like

* Thread safety on the list
* Changes within the list (beacon ranges changing)
* Removing items from the list if they have haven't been header
* Ensure performance by using proper buffering techniques behind the scenes

```csharp
IBeaconRangingManager rangingManager;

// TODO
```
