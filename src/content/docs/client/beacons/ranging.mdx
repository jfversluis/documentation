title: Beacons - Ranging
---

import LibBuilder from '../../../../components/Boilerplate/LibBuilder';

Beacon ranging is NOT a background operation.  Beacon ranging allows you to get all information on all beacons around you. 

## Setup

<LibBuilder componentName="beacons" client:load />

## Scanning

```csharp
IBeaconRangingManager rangingManager;

// TODO
```

## Managed Scan

The managed scan is meant to make it easier to show scan results for beacons.  It will manage things like

* Thread safety on the list
* Changes within the list (beacon ranges changing)
* Removing items from the list if they have haven't been header
* Ensure performance by using proper buffering techniques behind the scenes

```csharp
IBeaconRangingManager rangingManager;

var scanner = rangingManager.CreateManagedScan();
scanner.Start();


scanner.Dispose(); // <= make sure to dispose when you're done! 
```
