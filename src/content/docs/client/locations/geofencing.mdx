Geofencing is a very battery efficient setup for most background applications.  While similar to GPS listeners, it operates

:::warning[You can only register a maximum amount of geofence regions?]
- Android - 60
- iOS - 20
:::


## Features
* Fallback to standard GPS when Google Play Services is not available (please make sure to read [GPS documentation](./gps) for additional setup)

## Setup
<LibBuilder componentName="geofencing" client:load />


## Setup


### Creating a Background Listener (Delegate)


```csharp
public class MyGeofenceDelegate : Shiny.Locations.IGeofenceDelegate
{
    public Task OnStatusChanged(GeofenceState newStatus, GeofenceRegion region)
    {
        // do something here - iOS only gives you about 4 seconds to finish (plus whatever it took to initialize to get here)
    }
}
```
