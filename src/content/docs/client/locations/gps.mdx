import LibBuilder from '../../../../components/Boilerplate/LibBuilder';

## Getting Started
Xamarin Essentials is great, but Shiny makes realtime background location updates a thing on Xamarin/MAUI based platform.

:::note
While Shiny is built to support background operations, GPS can work in strictly a foreground perspective by simply registering
```csharp
services.AddGps();
```
without any GPS delegate.
:::

## Setup
<LibBuilder componentName="gps" client:load />

## Starting/Stopping the GPS Service

```csharp
IGpsManager gpsManager; // injected, resolved, etc
await gpsManager.StartListener(new GpsRequest
{
    UseBackground = true
});

gpsManager.StopListening();
```

## Watching Movement in the Foreground
```csharp

var subscription = this.manager
    .WhenReading()
    .Subscribe(reading => {
        // make sure to dispatch to your main thread here
    });


// and dispose of your subscription when done
subscription.Dispose();

```

## Observing in the background

```csharp
public class MyGpsDelegate : Shiny.Locations.IGpsDelegate 
{
    public MyGpsDelegate() 
    {
        // like all other shiny delegates, dependency injection works here
        // treat this as a singleton
    }


    public Task OnReading(IGpsReading reading)
    {
        // do something with the reading
    }
}
```
