import LibBuilder from '../../../../components/Boilerplate/LibBuilder';

## Getting Started
Xamarin Essentials is great, but Shiny makes realtime background location updates a thing on Xamarin platforms.

## Setup
<LibBuilder componentName="gps" client:load />

## Starting/Stopping the GPS Service

```csharp
IGpsManager gpsManager; // injected, resolved, etc
await gpsManager.StartListener(new GpsRequest
{
    UseBackground = true,
    Interval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5)
});

gpsManager.StopListening();
```

## Watching Movement in the Foreground
```csharp

var subscription = this.manager
    .WhenReading()
    .Subscribe(reading => {
        // make sure to dispatch to your main thread here
    });


// and dispose of your subscription when done
subscription.Dispose();

```
