import LibBuilder from '../../../../components/Boilerplate/LibBuilder';

## Getting Started 

As developers, we often take internet connectivity and speed for granted.  Mobile phones are taking HUGE sized photos these days that can take quite some time to upload.

## Features

* Background Uploads & Downloads on each platform
* Supports transfer filtering based on metered connections (iOS & UWP only at the moment)
* Event Based Metrics
  * Percentage Complete
  * Total Bytes Expected
  * Total Bytes Transferred
  * Transfer Speed (Bytes Per Second)
  * Estimated Completion Time

## Setup

<LibBuilder componentName="httptransfers" client:load />


## Background Delegate

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Shiny;

namespace YourNamespace;


public partial class MyHttpTransferDelegate : IHttpTransferDelegate
{

    public async Task OnError(HttpTransferRequest request, Exception ex) 
    {
    }

    public async Task OnCompleted(HttpTransferRequest request)
    {
    }
}

// in multitargeted solutions on Android, you can completely customize the foreground service notification
#if ANDROID
public partial class TestHttpTransferDelegate : IAndroidHttpTransferDelegate
{
    public void ConfigureNotification(AndroidX.Core.App.NotificationCompat.Builder builder, HttpTransfer transfer)
    {
            builder
                .SetContentTitle("MyApp")
                .SetContentText("My App is sending images")
                .SetSmallIcon(Resource.Mipmap.youricon);
    }
}

#endif

```

:::note[Android Foreground Service]
Android creates a foreground service that stays live until all transfers are complete (or have errored out).

The foreground service will also turn off if you CancelAll or Cancel the last transfer
:::


## Creating a Transfer


Transfers in Shiny v3 expose multipart form data

You can also pass custom (must be valid http header strings)

```csharp
IHttpTransferManager manager; // injected, resolved, etc

await manager.Queue(new HttpTransferRequest(
    "your UNIQUE identifier",
    "http://yourserver.com/upload", 
    true, // is upload (true) or download (false)
    "local file path", // local file path to upload from or download to
    TransferHttpContent? BodyContent = null,
    IDictionary<string, string>? Headers = null,
    bool AllowsConstrainedNetworkAccess = true,
    bool AllowsCellularAccess = true,
    bool? AssumesHttp3Capable = null    
));

```

### Watching a Specific Transfer

### Managed List

The managed list is meant manage a list of transfers

* The list is managed in a thread safe manner
* As new transfers are added, the list is updated
