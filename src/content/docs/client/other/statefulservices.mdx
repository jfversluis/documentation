title: Stateful Services
---

## Intro
Stateful services are simple way of maintaining state across execution/restarts/etc.  Essentially, you make your service a start

There are 3 requirements to having a stateful service
1. The service must be a singleton
2. The service must implement `System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged`
3. The service properties you wish to persist must be get/set
4. Your properties must be "simple" types or JSON serializable

```csharp
using Shiny;

namespace Whatever;

public class MyStatefulService : Shiny.NotifyPropertyChanged
{
}
```

And registering 

```csharp
using Shiny; // to emerge the extension methods

// wherever you register your services with the service collection
ServiceCollection services;
services.AddShinyService<MyStatefulService>();

```

:::tip
You can combine stateful services with [startup services](./startupservices)
