import LibBuilder from '../../../../components/Boilerplate/LibBuilder';

:::caution[DEPRECATION NOTICE]
Now that the MAUI Community Toolkit supports Speech Recognition, we may get rid of this module in the future.  The only reason we aren't just cutting it
is because we may bring this to webassembly

Uses the native platform speech recognition services to turn speech into text.
