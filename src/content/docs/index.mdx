        Shiny for the client side has its own hosting model to allow it to work across the whole .NET client side ecosystem by providing a common platform with all the services you need out-of-the-box.  Shiny is more of a framework with plugins built around
        it, than it is a "one off" plugin for a XF or MAUI application.  It is recommended not recommended you take a dependency on Shiny for a single plugin.

        The best way to get started with Shiny application is to use out templates <NugetBadge name="Shiny.Templates" client:load />

        > dotnet new install Shiny.Templates

        However, if you have an existing application, please try our [App Builder](client/appbuilder) to help generate all of the pieces you need.
